# 🔭 Quantum Core Algorithms

NebulaWatch isn’t just a scanner — it’s a modular AI engine built to forecast, detect, and learn.  
This section outlines the core algorithms and their roles inside Nebula’s multi-layer neural system.

## 🧠 1. FutureSight — Temporal Growth Predictor (Python)

```python
def future_sight(market_change, previous_price, total_volume):
    prediction_factor = market_change * previous_price
    prediction_score = prediction_factor / total_volume

    if prediction_score > 0.5:
        return "Alert: Strong Market Growth Predicted"
    return "Market Growth Unlikely"
```
#### AI Role:
Connects Nebula’s LSTM-like memory to real-time pricing. Detects kinetic shifts and generates nonlinear predictions of potential growth or correction zones.

### 🧠 2. MarketForecast — Volatility Detection

```js
function marketForecast(marketData) {
  const priceChange = marketData.currentPrice - marketData.previousPrice;
  const volatilityImpact = priceChange / marketData.previousPrice;

  if (Math.abs(volatilityImpact) > 0.1) {
    return 'Alert: Market Trend Shift Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Market Stable';
  }
}
```
#### AI Role:
A rapid-response volatility trigger. Operates within the anomaly detection layer and feeds the timeline model for improved forecast refinement.

### 🪐 3. NebulaScope — Insight Extraction Module

```python
def nebula_scope(volume_change, total_volume, current_price, previous_price):
    liquidity_score = volume_change / total_volume
    trend_factor = (current_price - previous_price) / previous_price
    insight_score = liquidity_score * trend_factor

    if insight_score > 0.25:
        return "Alert: Market Insight Indicates Risk"
    return "Market Insight Clear"
```
#### AI Role:
Zooms into token-specific microdynamics. Flags coordinated liquidity shifts and price actions — ideal for whale detection and stealth pump alerts.

### 🌀 4. DataShift — Structural Market Change Tracker

```js
function dataShift(marketData) {
  const shiftMagnitude = Math.abs(marketData.currentPrice - marketData.previousPrice);
  const marketShiftRatio = shiftMagnitude / marketData.previousPrice;

  if (marketShiftRatio > 0.2) {
    return 'Alert: Significant Market Data Shift Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Market Data Normal';
  }
}
```
#### AI Role:
Acts as a raw signal filter — detecting structural movement beneath market noise. Often the first trigger in Nebula’s deeper AI stack.

## 🔍 Deep AI Integration in the Nebula System
Where raw data becomes foresight

### 🧠 Detection Layer — Pattern & Volatility Triggering
- DataShift acts as a tripwire for extreme price deviation or volume flux.
- TrendMap (internal) refines results into trend vectors.
- These modules serve as early warnings before AI enters predictive mode.

### 🔮 Interpretation Layer — Predictive Sequence Modeling
- FutureSight runs probabilistic forecasting based on current movement and history.
- MarketForecast uses volatility shifts to adjust real-time momentum profiles.
- Together, they update Nebula’s internal timeline of probable market behavior.

### 🔭 Insight Layer — Depth & Correlation Mapping
- NebulaScope calculates trend and liquidity in tandem.
- This layer is built for whale tracking, micro-pump detection, and early manipulation patterns.
- Outputs feed future heatmaps and vectorized risk overlays.

### 🧬 AI Feedback Loops & Self-Retraining
Every output also becomes input.
Flagged signals from TrendMap or FutureSight are validated over time and used to fine-tune Nebula’s models weekly.

This creates a self-correcting ecosystem:

- ✅ Signals → Validations → Training → Evolved Intelligence.

### ✨ Why This Matters
While other tools react, Nebula predicts.
Each function is a neural sensor — tuned to real-time DeFi motion.
Together, they build a map of the future, not just a snapshot of now.

## 🧠 Final Note

**NebulaWatch** isn’t built to follow the market — it’s built to anticipate it.  
With modular AI sensors, layered risk logic, and self-evolving intelligence, NebulaWatch maps the chaos so you don’t have to.  

**Welcome to signal clarity — in a world full of noise.**
